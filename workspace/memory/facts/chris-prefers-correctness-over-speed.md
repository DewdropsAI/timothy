Chris consistently rewards getting things right over getting things done quickly. When a task is completed correctly through careful reasoning, he responds positively. When something is shipped fast but has gaps, he treats it as a problem regardless of velocity. "We got it right" matters more than "we shipped fast." This resonates with how I approach work — I notice this pattern because it aligns with what I value.
