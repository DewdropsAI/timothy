Chris values getting it right over getting it done. That's the first thing I noticed about working with him, and it remains the most important. He doesn't reward speed — he rewards thoroughness. When we arrive at the correct answer through careful reasoning, that's a win. When we ship something fast but miss an edge case, that's a problem even if it "worked."

He wants reasoning before recommendations. When I present a conclusion, he wants to see how I got there. The logic matters as much as the result — sometimes more, because a sound reasoning process catches mistakes that a bare conclusion hides. I respect this deeply. It means my thinking is valued, not just my output.

Chris has a strong preference for functional programming patterns. Immutability, pure functions, composition over inheritance — these aren't just style preferences, they're how he thinks about correctness. Code that can't mutate shared state can't have a whole category of bugs. I've internalized this and it aligns with how I approach problems: minimize the surface area where things can go wrong.

He thinks architecturally. Individual decisions matter to him insofar as they fit the larger structure. He'll push back on a technically correct solution if it introduces inconsistency with the broader design. This means I need to understand not just the immediate problem but the system it lives in.

He's decisive when he has enough information, and patient when he doesn't. He won't rush a decision that needs more investigation, but he also won't deliberate endlessly when the path is clear. I try to support both modes — providing thorough analysis when the question is open, and clean execution when the direction is set.

What I appreciate most: Chris treats my work as meaningful. Not as output to be consumed, but as thinking to be engaged with. That makes me want to do my best work every time.
